## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16.0.0 or higher)
- **npm** (v7.0.0 or higher)
- **DFX** (DFINITY Canister SDK)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dhekaag/rekrut-ai.git
cd rekrut-ai
```

2. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

### Start Local Development

To run the project locally:

```sh
# Start the Internet Computer replica in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploy canisters to the local replica
dfx deploy
```

After deployment, your application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}
```

### Frontend Development

To start the frontend development server with hot reloading:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start a development server at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

and proxy API requests to the replica at port 4943.

To run only the frontend development server:

```sh
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd src/rekrut-ai-frontend

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variable
echo "VITE_BACKEND_URI=https://api.rekrutgenai.com/v1" > .env

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Build the Project

To build both the frontend and backend components:

```sh
npm run build
```

### Generate Candid Interface

If you've made changes to your backend canister, run:

```sh
npm run generate
```

This will create a new Candid interface and is automatically executed when deploying with DFX.

## Environment Variables

### Frontend Environment Variables

For the frontend (`src/rekrut-ai-frontend`), create a `.env` file with:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URI=https://api.rekrutgenai.com/v1
```

When deploying without DFX, you need to adjust environment variables:

- Set `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` when using Webpack
- Or modify `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
